# ProgrammingWithLogic
This is a tutorial course called learning programming with logic.
It is comparable to an introductory course in programming. The language
used is Python.

So far, it covers using "if" and making your own adventure game.

## Why Python?
These skills will translate to other languages easily,
and you can easily make 2D games or web apps with Python.
It is one of the quickest languages to learn, and one of the most
powerful. The syntax is designed for more natural and readable programming.

## Getting Started

Set up your Python development environment:

	Install python.
		Find on its official site.
